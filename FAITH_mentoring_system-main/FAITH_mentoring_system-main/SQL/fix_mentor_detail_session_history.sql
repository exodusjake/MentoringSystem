-- fix_mentor_detail_session_history.sql
--
-- sp_GetMentorDetail's RS3 (the sessions list behind MonitorActivities/{id})
-- was hard-filtered to the CURRENT System Settings period:
--
--     WHERE  s.MentorID = @MentorID
--       AND  s.SchoolYear = @SchoolYear AND s.Semester = @Semester
--
-- @SchoolYear/@Semester here are always "whatever System Settings says
-- right now" (pulled at the top of the proc) -- there was no way to ask
-- for a past period. The instant Admin rolls Settings forward to a new
-- school year/semester, every session from the previous period silently
-- disappears from this result set -- not merely unlabeled, genuinely
-- excluded by the WHERE clause. This is the query behind:
--   - HEAD's Mentor Detail page (its whole sessions table)
--   - Admin's Mentor Detail hero stat cards (Admin's own sessions table
--     is safe -- it reads SessionsAdmin/{id}/sessions, i.e.
--     sp_GetMentorSessions, which never had this filter)
--
-- Fix: RS3 now returns the mentor's FULL session history, unfiltered by
-- period -- same convention already used by sp_GetMentorSessions and
-- sp_GetLogsheet (neither of those ever restricted to "current" only).
-- SchoolYear/Semester are added to RS3's own SELECT so the frontend can
-- group/filter by period client-side (mirrors the SessionRowDto/
-- LogsheetMenteeDto pattern already used for Mentor's own Sessions and
-- Logsheet pages).
--
-- RS1 (RequiredSessions), RS2's CompletedSessions, and RS4's per-mentee
-- SessionsAttended/TotalCompleted/LastAttended are UNCHANGED -- those are
-- genuinely "progress toward the current semester's quota" figures (the
-- same current-period scoping the Excellent/On Track/Behind/At Risk/
-- Critical classification already depends on system-wide), not a listing
-- of raw historical records, so narrowing them to "now" is correct as-is.
