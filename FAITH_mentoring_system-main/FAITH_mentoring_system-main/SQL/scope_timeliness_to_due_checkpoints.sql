-- scope_timeliness_to_due_checkpoints.sql
--
-- Timeliness previously treated EVERY required checkpoint slot as "late"
-- once not on time, even ones whose Deadline hasn't happened yet (e.g. a
-- mentor mid-semester at "After Midterms" was already being counted as
-- "late" for "Before Finals," which isn't due for months) -- confirmed
-- live: Miguel Santos read Timeliness 7% (the worst bracket) despite his
-- one submission so far being genuinely on time, because 11 of his 12
-- required checkpoint-slots simply aren't due yet and were being counted
-- against him anyway.
--
-- Client-confirmed fix: only a checkpoint whose Deadline has actually
-- passed counts toward the Timeliness denominator at all -- one not yet
-- due is excluded entirely (not required yet, not "late" yet), rather
-- than penalized early. Adds DueCheckpointCount (how many of the
-- semester's checkpoints have a Deadline that's already passed, as of
-- right now) to the settings result set both procs already return --
-- same for every mentor this period, scaled by each mentor's own
-- SectionCount in MonitorActivitiesService.cs, same as every other
-- required-count in that formula.
--
-- Completeness is untouched -- still scored against the full checkpoint
-- list (a document either exists or it doesn't, unrelated to timing).
