-- sp_GetMentorSessions: add a 3rd result set with each of the mentor's
-- sections and that section's OWN regular-session count for the current
-- school year + semester.
--
-- Why: the mentor-facing "X of 6 sessions this semester" counter summed
-- sessions across every section the mentor handles into one number, even
-- though the 6-session (5 for 2nd sem) quota is enforced PER SECTION
-- (SessionsController.Post's limit check is scoped by SectionCode). A
-- mentor with two sections could see "8 of 6" — over the displayed max —
-- while both sections were individually fine, or see the "Log Session"
-- button disabled while a section with room left was still available.
-- RS1's RegularSessionCount (mentor-wide) is left as-is for compatibility;
-- RS3 lets the frontend show/gate per section instead.
